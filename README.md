ðŸ‘‹Hi, I'm FÃ©lix and I'm a fullstack developer! 
I have a background in photography and recently completed an intensive 9-week bootcamp at Le Wagon, where I built several web applications using Ruby on Rails. I'm passionate about combining my graphic skills with web development to create visually appealing and user-friendly applications. Excited to bring creativity and technical expertise to my next project!
